This directory was an attempt to match death locations to weather stations from the GHCN.  Unfortunately, there are few stations with data in 2008, and those that are present are missing a lot of data.  Using this source of weather data is not recommended.

The R code to download and clean this data has been retained for historical purposes - it's a great illustration of very messy data.
