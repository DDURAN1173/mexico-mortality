README FILE FOR DAILY GLOBAL HISTORICAL CLIMATOLOGY NETWORK (GHCN-DAILY) 
Version 2.1

http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/readme.txt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. DOWNLOAD QUICK START

Start by downloading "ghcnd-stations.txt," which has metadata for all stations.

Then download one of the following TAR files:

  - "ghcnd-all.tar.gz" if you want all of GHCN-Daily, OR
  - "ghcnd-gsn.tar.gz" if you only want the GCOS Surface Network (GSN), OR
  - "ghcnd-hcn.tar.gz" if you only want the U.S. Historical Climatology Network 
    (U.S. HCN).

Then uncompress and untar the contents of the tar file, 
e.g., by using the following Linux command:

tar xzvf ghcnd_xxx.tar.gz

Where "xxx" stands for "all", "hcn", or "gsn" as applicable. The files will be 
extracted into a subdirectory under the directory where the command is issued.

ALTERNATIVELY, if you only need data for one station:

  - Find the station's name in "ghcnd-stations.txt" and note its station
    identification code (e.g., PHOENIX AIRPORT is "USC00026481"); and
  - Download the data file (i.e., ".dly" file) that corresponds to this code
    (e.g., "USC00026481.dly" has the data for PHOENIX AIRPORT).  
    Note that the ".dly" file is located in the "all" subdirectory.

III. FORMAT OF DATA FILES (".dly" FILES)

Each ".dly" file contains data for one station.  The name of the file
corresponds to a station's identification code.  For example, "USC00026481.dly"
contains the data for the station with the identification code USC00026481).

Each record in a file contains one month of daily data.  The variables on each
line include the following:

WMOID        81-85   Character
------------------------------

These variables have the following definitions:

ID         is the station identification code.  Note that the first two
           characters denote the FIPS  country code, the third character 
           is a network code that identifies the station numbering system 
           used, and the remaining eight characters contain the actual 
           station ID. 

           See "ghcnd-countries.txt" for a complete list of country codes.

           The network code  has the following five values:

           0 = unspecified (station identified by up to eight 
	       alphanumeric characters)
	   1 = Community Collaborative Rain, Hail,and Snow (CoCoRaHS)
	       based identification number.  To ensure consistency with
	       with GHCN Daily, all numbers in the original CoCoRaHS IDs
	       have been left-filled to make them all four digits long. 
	       In addition, the characters "-" and "_" have been removed 
	       to ensure that the IDs do not exceed 11 characters when 
	       preceded by "US1". For example, the CoCoRaHS ID 
	       "AZ-MR-156" becomes "US1AZMR0156" in GHCN-Daily.
           C = U.S. Cooperative Network identification number (last six 
               characters of the GHCN-Daily ID)
	   M = World Meteorological Organization ID (last five
	       characters of the GHCN-Daily ID)
	   N = Identification number used in data supplied by a 
	       National Meteorological or Hydrological Center
           W = WBAN identification number (last five characters of the 
               GHCN-Daily ID)

LATITUDE   is latitude of the station (in decimal degrees).

LONGITUDE  is the longitude of the station (in decimal degrees).

ELEVATION  is the elevation of the station (in meters, missing = -999.9).


STATE      is the U.S. postal code for the state (for U.S. stations only).

NAME       is the name of the station.

GSNFLAG    is a flag that indicates whether the station is part of the GCOS
           Surface Network (GSN). The flag is assigned by cross-referencing 
           the number in the WMOID field with the official list of GSN 
           stations. There are two possible values:

           Blank = non-GSN station or WMO Station number not available
           GSN   = GSN station 

HCNFLAG    is a flag that indicates whether the station is part of the U.S.
           Historical Climatology Network (HCN).  There are two possible values:

           Blank = non-HCN station
           HCN   = HCN station

WMOID      is the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) number for the
           station.  If the station has no WMO number, then the field is blank.
